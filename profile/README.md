## Hi there 👋

We are Kern AI, a team of ambitious data engineers and scientists aiming to make your life as a developer a bit easier. Our libraries and tools aim at shortening the data-centric AI lifecycle, in that you can easily create and manage large amounts of high-quality training data within hours.

In the next weeks, you'll see that the amount of repositories will become larger and larger, as we aim to open-source our work further. That definitely means that you should check out our organization every once in a while, or at least register for our newsletter on our [website](https://www.kern.ai/).

If you're interested in reaching out to us for any kind of reason, please don't hesitate. We're happy to help! 😄
